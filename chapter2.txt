I'm not the god, I'm just a normal human being.. I don't have the rights to make people realise their mistakes, I don't have the rights to say what's right and what's wrong, I'm not anyone to decide who's got the right to live and who don't...

I won't play god anymore... Karma will take care of everything..

Let's not make the karma turn to me in the process of becoming the karma to an unethical people..

I got to get rid of this god complexity..

I'm clean and legit... I'm the human being..
